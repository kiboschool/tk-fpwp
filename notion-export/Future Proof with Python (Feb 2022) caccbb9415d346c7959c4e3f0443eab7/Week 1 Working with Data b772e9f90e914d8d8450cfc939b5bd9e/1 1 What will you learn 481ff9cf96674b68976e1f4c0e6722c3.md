# 1.1. What will you learn?

*Estimated time: 10 minutes*

---

## Skills

In the next few weeks, you‚Äôll learn to make programs that can:

- Get input from the user, and show them messages
- Work with numbers and text
- Make decisions
- Repeat operations over again
- Work with lists of data

## Final Project Example

At the end of the course, you‚Äôll make a final project of your own design, using the skills you learn in the program.

Here‚Äôs a **Guess the Capital** project by a past student that shows the different concepts you‚Äôll learn. (*Press the green button to play the game*).

<aside>
ü§î You don‚Äôt need to understand this code yet. Each week, you‚Äôll learn more about how these work in detail. But, for now, you can just have fun with the project and get a sense of what will come later.

In the project code, you can see each of the concepts you‚Äôll learn over the next few weeks.

- **Data**: strings, numbers, booleans, and variables
    
    ```python
    # Strings, Numbers, Variables, and Booleans
    print("Welcome to GUESS THE CAPITAL")
    score = 0
    final_score > 50 and final_score < 70
    
    ```
    
- **Operators:** using `+` , `*`, `=`, and other symbols to do calculations and operations
    
    ```python
    option_labels[index] + ". " + capitals[option]
    score += ask_question(country)
    score * 10
    final_score > 50
    
    ```
    
- **Input and Output:** (`input` and `print`)
    
    ```python
    print("PERFECT SCORE! You are AWESOME!!")
    user_answer = input("Answer: ").upper()
    ```
    
- **Flow Control**: Conditional statements and Loops
    
    ```python
    for index in range(4):
        option = random_options[index]
        print(option_labels[index] + ". " + capitals[option])
    
      user_answer = input("Answer: ").upper()
      if user_answer in option_labels:
        answer_index = option_labels.index(user_answer)
    
        if random_options[answer_index] == country:
          return 1
    ```
    
- **Lists:** storing and operating on lots of pieces of data
    
    ```python
    countries = ["Indonesia", "Malaysia", "Austria", "Cameroon", "Colombia", "Jamaica", "Morocco", "Bolivia", "Canada", "Belgium", "Spain", "Australia", "Poland", "Chile", "Egypt", "Ghana", "Argentina", "Croatia", "Brazil", "France"]
    ```
    
- **Functions**: built-in functions, and user-defined functions
    
    ```python
    user_input.upper()
    random.sample(range(33), 4)
    
    def show_score(final_score):
      print (f"Your final score is {final_score}%")
    ```
    

In week 1, you‚Äôll learn the basics: **data**, **variables**, **operators**, **input** and **output**. 

In week 2, you‚Äôll learn flow control with **conditions** and **loops**

In week 3, you‚Äôll learn about storing data in **lists** and do more practice with **loops**

In week 4, you‚Äôll learn about **functions**.

## Mindset

Along the way, your mindset will change.

- You‚Äôll be less scared about computers and **more confident** üí™üèø
- You‚Äôll know **how to debug** and find a solution when things don‚Äôt work üêõ
- You‚Äôll make friends and **collaborate with teammates** üë•
- You‚Äôll learn how to **break problems down** into smaller pieces and solve them piece by piece üß©

Let‚Äôs hear from some Kibo alumni about their learning journey.
