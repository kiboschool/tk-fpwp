üë• This is a whole squad project. Use your squad text and voice channels in Discord to schedule time to work on the project together.

‚ö†Ô∏è¬†*Everyone on the squad should contribute. It should not be just one person writing the code.*

If you have trouble collaborating, or get stuck on the project, use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor.

üèâ **Working Together**
You can use [https://lettucemeet.com/](https://lettucemeet.com/) to find a time to work together. If no one‚Äôs posted it yet, you can go to that page, fill out your availability, then post a message in your squad channel like this:

> *Hi squad! This week‚Äôs assignment is a whole squad challenge. Everyone add your availability here [your lettucemeet link] so we can work together.*
> 

**Everyone on the squad should submit the assignment**. Once you have finished the shared squad version, you can copy and paste into your own Replit to submit.

**You should try to include everyone in your squad**. However, if someone is not responding on Discord, don‚Äôt worry - you won‚Äôt lose credit because someone else didn‚Äôt participate.
