# Wrapping Up (Final Steps for FPWP4)

Congratulations on ***almost*** finishing your FPWP journey. Below is what you need to do to finish strong.

## Earn Your Certificate

You have worked really hard and we want to recognize that work with a certificate you can share digitally. To earn your certificate, **you need to complete the following by end of day on Friday, March 11.**

- Complete all the assignments from Weeks 1 through 4, and submit in Replit. Assignments are below:
    - [**Assignment 1: Mad Libs**](../Week%201%20Working%20with%20Data%20b772e9f90e914d8d8450cfc939b5bd9e/Assignment%208f146751311d4d468ce22f003d361da1.md)
    - [**Assignment 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors**](../Week%202%20Flow%20Control%205749c192c99e4264ba67d6451167d581/Assignment%208151b49e4fce49b1b67b8af1d816308c.md)
    - [**Assignment 3: Squad Info Bot](../Week%203%20Loops%20and%20Lists%20a264f8bb18cf440ca01720ecfc637939/Assignment%2094128c02a4684b0ba1928f71f3c919a7.md) OR [P3.5 - Longest Word](https://replit.com/team/fpwp-feb2022/P35-Longest-Word)**
- Complete the [**Final Project**](Final%20Project%20Instructions%20bed96d4c765d44349508fb8f5618bc4e.md)
- Complete the [Program Feedback Survey](https://forms.gle/dRKVfWugL8ACtWfK9)

**Notes:** 

- [Assignment 4: Random Story Generator](../Week%204%20Functions%2079102c0759c143e7bf92b0c56f4820ee/Assignment%20%5BOptional%5D%2075ff2a95f9b84b77a072dac6d762a6e9.md) is **optional.** You don‚Äôt need to complete it to get the certificate.
- **[P3.5 Longest Word](https://replit.com/team/fpwp-feb2022/P35-Longest-Word)** is an alternative to **Assignment 3: Squad Info Bot**, since it‚Äôs hard to make up a squad project. You can submit either one for the certificate.
