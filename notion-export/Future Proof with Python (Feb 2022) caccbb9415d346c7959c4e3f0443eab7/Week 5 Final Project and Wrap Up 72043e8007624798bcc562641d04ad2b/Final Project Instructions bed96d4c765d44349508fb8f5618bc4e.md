# Final Project Instructions

Congratulations on making it this far in your Future Proof journey! It’s been a fun-filled few weeks. Now it’s time for you to put your Python skills to test by building a program of your own design. The final project is a chance to  🙌🏿 **celebrate what you’ve learned** **🎉**  and ✨**explore the creativity of coding**.🎨

👥 This is a team project. Schedule time to work on the project together. Teams can be a **max size of 3** people. 

If you cannot or do not wish to work with a teammate, you may work on the project alone. If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor.

### Before You Start

- Brainstorm and agree on the basic design for the project before you start coding.
- Use pen and paper to draw out the interactions before you code.
- Work on your project in steps, as we experienced during the course, and make sure you test each part before moving to the next.
- When you need help anytime, **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo 😉

✨✨Have fun!✨✨
