# Lesson 0: Learning With Kibo

E*stimated Time: 1 hour 30 mins*

---

In this lesson, you’ll get an overview of how learning at Kibo works, instructions to set up the tools you need, and a brief intro to Python.

## Before you start...

At Kibo we love learning together!

[As a tradition, we take a “peakture” together on zoom!](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLV8Ai7156wBfMB0f3AXB91QuaBcqiC6QlBL4EfLCPhtb-K02tTmoITNihlfmhF7h2ycRLc-ts-Cqf05A4qJ_LXiIzg8kDBqRZ6yjf3UYM_3WxHWLFqhuvX5vvElXWKFttROKTFjwn3dREsefDXyECFh=w2548-h1592-no?authuser=0)

Kibo is different from other classes you have been a part of.

- Kibo is an online program. That means that **you’re in charge of your own learning**.
- A lot of the learning is **asynchronous:** you go at your own pace. There is a **weekly live class** everyone will attend, and weekly assignments everyone will submit.
- Get ready for a challenging journey. Learning to code takes time!
- Learning to code takes time! You need to **schedule lots of practice time.**
- We love learning to code together. Once the program starts, you’ll **work with partners and groups**.

We want everyone who enrolls in Kibo to be successful. 

Before you can fully enroll in the program, we want to check that Kibo-style learning works for you. You’ll read the following pages and submit two brief assignments.

⚠️ **You must submit the two Replit assignments** to complete your enrollment in the program.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this Lesson, you will be able to:

- Use **Replit** and **Notion** to learn with Kibo
- Use basic input and output in Python
- Learn about the **debugging** **mindset** for learning to program
