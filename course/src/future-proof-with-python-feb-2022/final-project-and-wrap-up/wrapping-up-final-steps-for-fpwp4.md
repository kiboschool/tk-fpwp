# Wrapping up final steps for fpwp4

Congratulations on ***almost*** finishing your FPWP journey. Below is what you need to do to finish strong.

## Earn Your Certificate

You have worked really hard and we want to recognize that work with a certificate you can share digitally. To earn your certificate, **you need to complete the following by end of day on Friday, March 11.**

- Complete all the assignments from Weeks 1 through 4, and submit in Replit. Assignments are below:
    - [**Assignment 1: Mad Libs**](/future-proof-with-python-feb-2022/working-with-data/assignment.md)
    - [**Assignment 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors**](/future-proof-with-python-feb-2022/flow-control/assignment.md)
    - [**Assignment 3: Squad Info Bot](P35-Longest-Word)**
- Complete the [**Final Project**](/future-proof-with-python-feb-2022/final-project-and-wrap-up/final-project-instructions.md)
- Complete the [Program Feedback Survey](https://forms.gle/dRKVfWugL8ACtWfK9)

**Notes:** 

- [Assignment 4: Random Story Generator](/future-proof-with-python-feb-2022/functions/assignment-optional.md) is **optional.** You don‚Äôt need to complete it to get the certificate.
- **[P3.5 Longest Word](https://replit.com/team/fpwp-feb2022/P35-Longest-Word)** is an alternative to **Assignment 3: Squad Info Bot**, since it‚Äôs hard to make up a squad project. You can submit either one for the certificate.
