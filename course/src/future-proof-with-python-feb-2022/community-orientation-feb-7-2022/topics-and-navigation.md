### Weekly Materials

Each week, there will be:

- Readings and Videos in Notion
- Practice Problems in Replit (with solutions and video walkthroughs)
- A required Assignment (usually a Team project)
- A Live Session with an instructor or TA
- Office Hours with an instructor or TA

## Navigating the lessons in Notion

Lessons are here in Notion. They will be released once a week on Sunday evening.

Each lesson includes:

- An **overview** page explaining what the week is about
- A page for each of the key **concepts** in the lesson
- A page of **Practice** exercises
- An **Assignment** with details about work you must submit. Your assignments all have due dates.
- A **wrap-up** page that includes a summary of the lesson and a chance for you to give us feedback.
    
    *Feedback is a gift, and we appreciate hearing from you!*
    

You can use the top navigation bar (highlighted in the below image) and the links at the bottom of each page, to navigate through the lessons.

![Lesson%20Topics%20and%20Navigation%20b7c3276fdfae4ee3bea3d72a01f422ad/Screen_Shot_2021-07-30_at_1.50.42_PM.png](/future-proof-with-python-feb-2022/community-orientation-feb-7-2022/topics-and-navigation/screen-shot-2021-07-30-at-1.50.42-pm.png)

The overview page for each lesson will also have links to each of the other pages for that week.

## Practice and Model Solutions

Each week, there is a page of **Practice** problems. Practice problems are your chance to put what youâ€™ve learned into action. Try solving the challenges to check that you understand the concepts.

The practice problems each have **Model Solutions**. If you click 'Submit' on the assignment, you can view the model solution from the assignments page. See the video below to see how to view the model solutions.

Some practice problems also have **video solutions.** The video solution will be next to the Practice assignment in Notion.

ðŸš§ Try to go through each challenge without using the solution. *If you canâ€™t do the challenge without the solution, it means you donâ€™t understand the material well enough yet.*

## Assignments

Each week, you will have a required assignment. Usually, youâ€™ll need to work on with a partner or in your squad. **Be sure to read the whole assignment page and submit all parts of each assignment!**

All assignments will have

- A link to **Replit** to submit your work
- **Instructions** for what to do
- A **rubric** explaining what successful work looks like
- A **reflection form** after you complete the project

### Week by Week

The assignments for the course will be

- Week 1: **Mad Libs** (Team)
- Week 2: **Rock, Paper, Scissors** (Solo)
- Week 3: **Squad Info Bot** (Squad Project)
- Week 4: **Random Story Generator** (Team)
- Week 5: **Final Project** (Team)

### Types of Assignments

**Solo Projects** are for you to work on by yourself. You should ask for help if you get stuck, but the solution you submit is your own.

**Team Projects** are for you to work on with one or two other classmates. You should use Discord to find teammates and find time to work together. You should each submit a copy of the assignment, but it can be copied from your teammateâ€™s version (**which you all created together!**).

**Squad Projects** are for you to work on with your whole squad. Everyone on the squad will submit a version of the project, but it can be copied from one squad memberâ€™s version (**which you all created together!**).

For **Team Projects**, the reflection form will include feedback for your partner.

At the end of each page is a link to the next page, like this:
