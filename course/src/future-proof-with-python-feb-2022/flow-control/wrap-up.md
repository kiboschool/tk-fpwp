# Wrap up

*Estimated time: 5 minutes*

## Summary

- `if` statements let us write code that makes decisions
- We can use comparison operators like `==`, `<`, `>` to compare values and get `True` or `False`
- `elif` and `else` blocks let us handle more complicated branching situations
- We can combine booleans expressions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
- `while` repeats code for as long as a condition is True
- `break` lets us stop a loop early, and `continue` lets us skip to the next iteration of the loop
- `for` repeats code for a specific number of iterations
- `range` lets us control the start, end, and step size of a `for` loop
