In this lesson, you learned:

- Functions allow us to write some code once in our program, then run it as many times as needed.
- Functions are used (i.e. called or invoked) by writing the name followed by parentheses, with the function's arguments contained within the parentheses.
- Python has many built-in functions, like `print()`, `str()`, and `random.randint()`
- You can find available functions and modules by looking at the Python docs or searching Google
- Python lets you define your own functions using the keyword `def`
- `return` sends back a value from a function
